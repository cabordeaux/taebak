				<h2>Philosophy</h2>
				<ul>
				<li><p>
				Since 1961, our projects have been widely accepted in California and beyond.  We pride ourselves on exceeding the city and county expectations, maintaining developers’ budgets and projections versus actual economic ups and downs, and communicating effectively with the individual homeowner and surrounding neighbors during endless battles between clients’ requests and regulatory requirements, city standards and actual job conditions.</p></li>
				<li><p>
				<strong>Our history is interwoven with that of our clients’ projects and events.  We count time not by hours but by our professional successes</strong>.  Our expertise extends to both the private and public sectors as we continue to provide land survey services for large scale community development, infrastructure and individual homeowners alike.  Our passion shows from the moment we make contact.  We have found that establishing a common ground between all parties is the foundation of each successful project.  As projects become larger and more complex we always keep this in mind.</p></li>
